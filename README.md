### =========================
### NELSONDIO: steps to get here:
1) Pull request
2) create a pull request
3) nelsondio:master vs wolfsonuser:master there isn't anything to compare since the pull request was automatically merged by nelsondio a few minutes back.
4) Try switching the base for your comparison: 
5) base repository nelsondio/hello-world base: master <==== head repository wolfsonuser/hello-world compare: master
6) with an option: compare across forks. This is the option I selected previously. When I made a pull request, automatically generated a branch patch-1.
7) After base allowed to merge with head of wolfsonuser, it showed option to delete wolfsonuser/hello-world but a BIGGGG warning in setting, dangerous, risky, be carefull!!!. I authorized since I can write in nelsondio. 
8) Pending what to do with wolfsonuser/hello-world since master and patch-1 are not merged yet.
### ==============================
## Wolfsonuser patch-2 pull request started.
### follow the steps and see after commiting changes.
